# hardware-almanac.com - What's that part?
This github page is for the development of a website for a catalogue of all common computer hardware.

You can visit www.hardware-almanac.com for more information; when this github project is sufficiently developed enough to be used by others, www.hardware-almanac.com will look just like http://1-21gigawatts.github.io/hardware-almanac.

If you'd like to contribute, don't hesitate!
